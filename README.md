# Job Board Backend

Welcome to the **Job Board Backend** project! This is a powerful, real-world backend system designed to power a job board platform with robust role management, efficient data retrieval, and seamless API integration. Whether you're a developer looking to sharpen your skills or a team building a scalable job platform, this project offers hands-on experience with modern backend development practices.

## Real-World Application

This project prepares you to build production-ready backend systems by tackling challenges faced by platforms like Indeed, LinkedIn Jobs, or local job boards. Through this project, you'll gain practical skills in:

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Securely manage permissions for admins and users with JWT authentication.
- **Database Design**: Craft efficient schemas to handle complex relationships and large datasets.
- **Query Optimization**: Boost performance with indexing and advanced search techniques.

## Project Overview

The Job Board Backend is a case study in creating a scalable, feature-rich backend for a job board platform. It powers job postings, user applications, and advanced search functionality while ensuring security and performance. With comprehensive API documentation and a modular design, itâ€™s built to integrate seamlessly with any frontend.

## Project Goals

- **API Development**: Deliver a robust set of APIs for managing job postings, categories, and applications.
- **Access Control**: Implement secure, role-based authentication for admins and users.
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimize job search with indexing and tailored query performance.
